      time study
    </div>
    <p class="white">This is a <span class="teal">work measurement technique</span> done by slicing the task into elements and timing each element, establishing ratings, and assigning appropriate allowances to determine time standards. It is mostly used for <span class="teal">routine tasks</span>.</p>
    <p class="white">In Industrial Engineering, it is part of <span class="teal">Methods Engineering</span>, which deals with constructing new methods from existing ones. Methods Engineering is one of the four ways of generating solutions in a systems study. Others are Production Systems, Human Factors and Ergonomics, and Operations Research.</p>

      history & importance
    </div>
    <p class="white">The time (and motion) study used today is a combination of the motion study invented by <span class="teal">Frank B. Gilbreth and Lillian M. Gilbreth</span> and the <span class="teal">time study</span> invented by Frederick W. Taylor in 1881.</p>

    <p class="white">“Time study is the one element in scientific management beyond all others making possible the transfer of skill from management to men.” - Frederick W. Taylor</p>

    <p class="white">Time studies are important as they assist a company in evaluating and analyzing costs and productivity. They highlight where a facility needs to improve in order to cut costs, and improve efficiencies. It <span class="teal">enhances production quality</span> and <span class="teal">utilizes maximum resource capacity</span> in minimum time.</p>

      conducting a time study
    </div>
    <p class="white">In this site, the following steps were followed (with some changes to the ordering) in order to conduct an accurate time study.</p>
    <ol class="white">
      <li>Break down the task into <span class="teal">elements</span></li>
      <li>Record the <span class="teal">observed time</span> per element</li>
      <li>Assign <span class="teal">performance rating</span> per element or per cycle</li>
      <li>Calculate the <span class="teal">normal time</li>
      <li>Provide appropriate <span class="teal">allowances</span></li>
      <li>Compute for <span class="teal">standard time</span></li>
