      for the site
    </div>
    <p>The title of the site, <span class="orange">about time</span>, is a reference to the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/">2013 movie</a> of the same name. Since this site <i>is</i> about time. And it's about time that there's a time study site!</p>
    <p>I used AngularJS (with <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-multi-step-form-using-ui-router">UI router</a>) as the backbone of this site. Bootstrap was used as the CSS framework. I drew inspiration from <a href="http://dribbble.com/Tamarashvili">Giga Tamarashvili</a> for the design. The pattern used as a background is from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com">subtlepatterns</a>. There was a ton of stackoverflow use as well.</p>
    <p>Note that there are some minor bugs here and there. I didn't have enough time to test it out thoroughly. The design isn't responsive, meaning, I didn't plan it for mobile. That is included in the future plans for this site.</p>
